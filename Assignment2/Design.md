- Interact through likes, comments, and following.
- Engage in direct messaging.
- Discover content via search and explore features.

Key objectives:
- *Scalability*: Support for millions of users.
- *Real-time Communication*: Seamless interaction via chats and notifications.
- *User Engagement*: Features like stories, feeds, and recommendations to keep users engaged.

### 1.3 Overview
This document is structured to provide:
- High-level system overview and architecture.
- Detailed breakdown of data and component designs.
- Overview of user interfaces and their interactions.
- Mapping of requirements to implemented features.

### 1.4 Reference Material
- User experience research in social media apps.
- Studies on scalable backend architectures for real-time communication.
- Modern practices in multimedia storage and delivery.

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

## 3. System Architecture
### 3.1 Architectural Design
The system architecture is modular and comprises:
- *Frontend*: Mobile app and web interface for user interaction.
- *Backend Services*: Authentication, content management, and recommendation algorithms.
- *Real-time Communication Layer*: Manages chats and notifications.
- *Database Layer*: Persistent storage for user, post, and messaging data.

### 3.2 Decomposition Description
- 3.2.1 **User Interface Module**
  - Login and Registration
  - Feed Viewer
  - Profile Page
  
- 3.2.2 **Backend Module**
  - User Management
  - Content Delivery
  - Recommendation Algorithms
  
- 3.2.3 **Messaging Module**
  - Real-time Messaging
  - Multimedia Sharing


### 3.3 Design Rationale
Modularity allows independent updates and scaling of specific features. For instance, the messaging system can be improved without impacting the feed delivery service.
