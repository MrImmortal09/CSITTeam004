## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Introduction

### Purpose
The Instagram Clone project aims to create a social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, stories, and interact with others through likes, comments, and direct messaging. The goal is to replicate key features of Instagram and provide an intuitive user experience for connecting and sharing content globally.

### Scope
This project includes the following features:
- User authentication (sign-up, login, password recovery)
- Photo and video posting with optional filters
- Liking, commenting, and sharing posts
- Following/unfollowing users
- Direct messaging between users
- Story creation and sharing
- User notifications for interactions

The project will be developed as a web application, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
The Instagram Clone will function as a standalone social media platform, integrating with external services for email notifications, cloud storage for media uploads, and social login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook). It will feature a REST API for future integration with mobile applications.

### Product Functions
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, password recovery, and social logins.
- **Content Posting**: Upload photos, videos, and stories with editing and filter options.
- **Interaction**: Like, comment, and follow/unfollow users.
- **Direct Messaging**: Private messaging between users.
- **Feed**: Displays posts from followed users.
- **Notifications**: Alerts users of interactions such as likes, comments, follows, and messages.

### User Characteristics
Target users are individuals familiar with social media platforms, ranging from casual users to influencers. Users expect a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate interface.

### Constraints
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
- **Performance**: Handle a large number of users and media uploads efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensure strong data protection for user information and media.

### Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to stable internet connections.
- External services such as cloud storage, email verification, and social login APIs are available and functioning.

## Specific Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **User Registration & Login**: Users can sign up, log in, or recover passwords through email or social login.
- **Post Creation**: Users can upload media (photos/videos) with optional captions and filters.
- **Likes & Comments**: Users can interact with posts by liking or commenting, and receive notifications.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow or unfollow others, and their feeds will update accordingly.
- **Direct Messaging**: Users can communicate with each other through private messages.
- **Story Sharing**: Users can create and share stories that disappear after 24 hours.
- **Notifications**: Users receive real-time notifications of interactions.

### Interface Requirements
- **User Interface**: A responsive web interface optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Hardware Interface**: Compatible with modern web-enabled devices for media uploads.
- **Software Interface**: REST APIs for communication between frontend and backend services. Integration with cloud storage for media.
- **Communication Interface**: Use of HTTP/HTTPS protocols for data transmission and WebSockets for real-time notifications.

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: System should load pages and respond within 2 seconds under normal traffic.
- **Scalability**: Must handle up to 1 million concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Availability**: System uptime of 99.9%.

### Logical Database Requirements
- **User Table**: Stores user details (e.g., username, email, password).
- **Posts Table**: Stores post details including media, captions, timestamps, and user IDs.
- **Comments Table**: Stores user comments on posts.
- **Followers Table**: Manages follower relationships between users.
- **Messages Table**: Stores direct messages between users.

### Design Constraints
- **Regulatory Compliance**: The system must comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations.
- **Hardware Limitations**: Optimized for standard devices, capable of handling high-resolution uploads.
- **Third-party Dependencies**: System depends on cloud services and external APIs for key functionalities (e.g., storage, email verification).

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)###
Security
Authentication: Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, allowing secure login via email and social media accounts.
Authorization: Role-based access control to manage permissions for different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
Data Encryption: Utilize HTTPS for data in transit and AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest (e.g., user passwords, private messages).
Maintainability
Code Modularity: Structure the codebase using a modular design pattern to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for APIs, libraries, and code to assist developers in future enhancements.
Automated Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure that new updates do not introduce bugs.
Portability
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the application can run on various platforms (iOS, Android, web) using responsive design and platform-agnostic technologies (e.g., React Native).
Containerization: Use Docker for deploying the application, making it easier to run in different environments without compatibility issues.
Reliability
Uptime: Aim for 99.9% uptime to ensure the application is consistently available to users.
Error Handling: Implement robust error logging and monitoring to detect issues in real-time, along with user-friendly error messages to enhance user experience.
Usability
User Interface Design: Focus on an intuitive UI with clear navigation, ensuring users can easily access features like posting, commenting, and messaging.
Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation.
Performance
Response Time: Aim for a maximum response time of 2 seconds for loading feeds and images to enhance user experience.
Throughput: Design the system to handle at least 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
Optimization: Utilize content delivery networks (CDNs) for faster media loading and optimize database queries to reduce load times.
